# FifteenPuzzle_GameLearningPrototype
This is my first C# project, it's from January 2022, and I made this program as a prototype for a Fifteen Puzzle Tile game, in MonoGame, to get used to C# and learn good coding practices for developing video games.

The project uses the MonoGame framework, v3.8.0, and C# .Net Core 3.1, and it's a game that I created in order to learn about programming concepts such as OOP, and the best practices to use when developing video games.
This game isn't complete as it's just a learning project where I tried to write clean code. The intention of this project was to learn C#, learn working with a library, and learn best coding practices for developing software.

If you want to have a look at the code or compile the program, you can download the source code, and run it in an IDE such as Visual Studio 2022, or later (whenever a new VS version comes out.).
